## 🚀 About Me
💻 My coding journey began with a desire to solve real-world problems in the industries I worked in. I love researching problems, understanding users, and developing solutions that make their lives easier.

🥈 My second favorite part of development? Thinking about how my product can best serve its users. 

🥇 My favorite part? Seeing it improve their lives!

🥏 When I'm not at my computer, you can catch me chasing a plastic circle around a field with friends, exploring hiking trails, or inviting strangers to a game of doubles.
